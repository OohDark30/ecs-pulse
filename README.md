# ecs-pulse
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ecs-pulse is a PYTHON based data collection module for DELL EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage Product.

The collected data is stored in both InfluxDB and ElasticSearch depending on the type of data
collected and then we provide Grafana examples charts to show what can be done with the data
for visual monitoring.
