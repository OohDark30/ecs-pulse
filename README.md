# ecs-pulse
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ecs-pulse is a PYTHON based data collection module for DELL EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage Product.

ecs-pulse utilizes the ECS Managment REST API's to gather monitoring data from ECS which is then
stored in InfluxDB.  

We also provide sample Grafana dashboards and panels that use the InfluxDB data to demonstrate how 
it can be displayed visually.
