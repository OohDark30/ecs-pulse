----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ecs-pulse is a PYTHON based data collection module for DELL EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage Product.

ecs-pulse utilizes the ECS Managment REST API's to gather monitorinig data which is stored in 
InfluxDB.  We provide sample Grafana dashboards and panels to demonstrate how this date can be
displayed visually.
